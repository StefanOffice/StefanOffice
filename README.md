# About me  
Since childhood i was interested in crafts, in ***how things are made***, 
what are they made from. I broke my toys and put them together again.
I was interested in components, and how they fit together. 
Later on i started making small objects from wood, toothpicks, wallnut shells and what not. Come highschool,
i was making objects from bent wire and crystals, bracelets, rings...

Different times, different things, but there was always that ***desire to see the 
essence of something and to replicate or improve it***. There was also a 
common reccuring problem however, i was limited with the materials and tools 
that were avaliable, that slowed me down a little bit, but it never stopped me.

Then i started getting interested in economics, and management.
I started looking beyond individual components and their relationships and 
more and more into the ***systems*** that they were forming, the structures, the hierarchies and
the organization. Which led me to my bachelors degree in economics and my own 
printing company.

At one point or another i discovered code and programming, and as soon as i peeked under
that hood, i was blasted away. I realized that it combines all of my different areas 
of interest, it had ***components***, that can be as general or as specific as your heart desires,
it had ***relationship management***, creation and ***implementation of systems***, the organization
and structure of data, and ***logical problem solving*** that connects it all together. 
The components could be assembled in countless ways(more than toothpicks ever could)
and best of all i could create my own components and was not limited by 
materials or tools, only by my own creativity, time and knowledge. 
Then i discovered Design Patterns,the blueprints of solutions and building blocks of systems,
huge communities of focused and sharp minds with common interest and openness to share and learn.
I am trying to keep this description short, so i will not go into more detail, but
the more i learned about programming the more i was drawn in. I realized
that i have found my ***drive and passion*** and that ***coding is something i really enjoy doing***.
